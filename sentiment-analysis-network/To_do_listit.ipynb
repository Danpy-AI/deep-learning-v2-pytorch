    "# Project 6: Reducing Noise by Strategically Reducing the Vocabulary<a id='project_6'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO:** Improve `SentimentNetwork`'s performance by reducing more noise in the vocabulary. Specifically, do the following:\n",
    "* Copy the `SentimentNetwork` class from the previous project into the following cell.\n",
    "* Modify `pre_process_data`:\n",
    ">* Add two additional parameters: `min_count` and `polarity_cutoff`\n",
    ">* Calculate the positive-to-negative ratios of words used in the reviews. (You can use code you've written elsewhere in the notebook, but we are moving it into the class like we did with other helper code earlier.)\n",
    ">* Andrew's solution only calculates a postive-to-negative ratio for words that occur at least 50 times. This keeps the network from attributing too much sentiment to rarer words. You can choose to add this to your solution if you would like.  \n",
    ">* Change so words are only added to the vocabulary if they occur in the vocabulary more than `min_count` times.\n",
    ">* Change so words are only added to the vocabulary if the absolute value of their postive-to-negative ratio is at least `polarity_cutoff`\n",
    "* Modify `__init__`:\n",
    ">* Add the same two parameters (`min_count` and `polarity_cutoff`) and use them when you call `pre_process_data`"
